# Merkelrex
Cryptocurrency Trader Simulation

I created a command-line user interface and a simulation of the Merklerex exchange that enables a human to engage in trading activities like offering and accepting trades, performing market analysis, and so forth.

The base code was provided by UOL, with changes made by me. Whereas the code in advisorbot.h & advisor.cpp was created by me in full.
